# 📦Case Study 1- Build Your APP (Student tracker App)

This FastAPI app allows students to register, track their weekly progress in the bootcamp, and view others' progress (using a shared MongoDB Atlas backend).

## 🚀 Goal (This Week)
> Dockerize this app, run it locally in a container, and push your image to DockerHub. You should be able to:
- Run the app inside Docker
- Test the API on your browser
- Share the image on DockerHub

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

Ensure the following are already installed in your VM (from [1.0 - Set Up Your Environment](https://github.com/ChisomJude/Hands-on-Devops-CloudNative/tree/master/1.0%20Setup%20your%20Enviroment)):

- Docker  
- Git  
- Python 3 & Pip  
- Kubernetes tools (kubectl, kind)  
- A MongoDB Atlas cluster with your connection string

---

## 🧪 Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Clone the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChisomJude/student-project-tracker.git
cd student-project-tracker

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root:

```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/cloud_native?retryWrites=true&w=majority
# We are using a central db, vault credentials will be provided in the Class Group, if you aren't part of the class you can create yours
```

### 3. Run Locally (Optional Test)
To test the app locally before Dockerizing:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

#Go to: http://<your-VM-public-IP>:8000/docs, ensure Port 8000 is open in the network security group, and confirm this works
```


### 4. Build your image
A Dockerfile is already provided in the project repo; however, feel free to modify it to suit your needs.

✅ Build the image 
<br>✅ and run it locally<br>
✅ Push to to your dockerhub

# Check the app on your broswer or curl http://<your-vm-ip>:8000/docs
```
#### Push to DockerHub

```bash
docker login
docker push yourdockerhubusername/student-tracker: latest
```
